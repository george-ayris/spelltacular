# Spelltacular

A web app to help teachers with the setting of spelling homework. 

Stack:
- Backend is in Python hosted in AWS Lambda and uses SAM local for local deployments
- Frontend is in ClojureScript
- Database is Postgresql

A project designed to teach me how to get a an app up and running in a close to production state using AWS in a minmalistic fashion, where I understand all the moving parts and automating where it makes sense. Also an opportunity to learn ClojureScript after my interest has been piqued by the talks of Rich Hickey.
